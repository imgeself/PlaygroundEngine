This is my personal game engine project for learning and testing real-time rendering tecniques. 
It is more like a renderer than a game engine now but I want to implement animation, physics, audio, etc. in the future.

### Some Features:
- Abstracted Direct3D 11 rendering API
- GLTF 2.0 scene loading
- Physically based rendering with Cook-Torrance BRDF
- Image Based Lighting
- Cascaded Shadow Mapping
- Forward shading with Z prepass
- Logging, Profiling, etc

### Roadmap:
I am planning to add mode features into this project. You can see the roadmap [here](https://github.com/imgeself/PlaygroundEngine/projects/1)

### Requirements:
 - Windows 10
 - Visual Studio 2019
 
### Building and Running:
You can just clone the repo and open the solution file in VS2019 and press F5. It should build and run without any problem.
