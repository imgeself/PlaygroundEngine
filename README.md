This is my personal game engine project for learning and testing real-time rendering tecniques. 
It is more like a renderer than a game engine now but I want to implement animation, physics, audio, etc. in the future.

### Some Features:
- Abstracted Direct3D 11 rendering API
- GLTF 2.0 scene loading
- Physically based rendering with Cook-Torrance BRDF
- Image Based Lighting
- Normal mapping
- Multisample Anti-aliasing (MSAA)
- HDR rendering
- Cascaded Shadow Mapping
- Omnidirectional Shadow Mapping
- Forward shading with Z prepass
- Logging, Profiling, etc

### Roadmap:
I am planning to add mode features into this project. You can see the roadmap [here](https://github.com/imgeself/PlaygroundEngine/projects/1)

### Requirements:
 - Windows 10
 - Visual Studio 2019
 
### Building and Running:
You can just clone this repo and open the solution file in VS2019 and press F5. It should build and run without any problem.

Use WASD keys to move the camera, hold left-click and drag the mouse to rotate the camera.
